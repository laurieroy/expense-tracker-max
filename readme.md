# Expense Tracker - WIP
This is a work in progress... It's another Expense Tracker, built in React (17). 

I've liked Max's explanations on his previous courses, so I'm following along on a more current course to understand testing and more current styling (than a previous 2017 course).

The user can add an Expense title, amount, and date.  This list can be filtered by date. 

This is a code along from [Academind GmbH](https://academind.com/)'s [React - The Complete Guide (includes Hooks, React Router, and Redux) [ 2021 Updated ]  - Second Edition](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/?couponCode=D_0621). I accessed the course through Packt so might not be the same verson.

Tech Stack:

React 17
<!-- Redux  -->
<!-- Webpack4 with babel-preprocessor -->

<!-- Tested with Jest, Enzyme -->
In your terminal:

<!-- [Use the demo version:] Hosted on Heroku, so it might take a few seconds to spin up. It's worth it! -->
